#[Network Configuration]
# [NAE Server IP]
# The IP address and port of the NAE server.
#
# Multiple IPs can be specified when load balancing is used. The port must
# be the same on all NAE servers.  You can configure up to three tiers of
# NAE servers.  Tiers are numbered 1-3.  If all servers in the primary tier 1
# become unreachable, the client will switch to tier 2.   If all servers
# in tier 2 become unrechable, the client will switch to tier 3.  When
# using an alternatate tier, the client will periodically try to switch
# back to tier 1 (after Connection_Retry_Interval has expired).
# 
# For all tier-aware parameters, the tier is indicated with a trailing
# .n after the parameter name, i.e. NAE_IP.1=127.0.0.1
# Setting the parameter with no tier sets the default value for all tiers.
# i.e. Connection_Timeout=600000 sets Connection_Timeout for all tiers while
# Connection_Timeout.1=700000 sets Connection_Timeout for tier 1.
# A tier-specic setting will override
#
# For NAE_IP, IPs are separated by colons, e.g.,
# 192.168.1.10:192.168.1.11:192.168.1.12

# #[Network Configuration]
# [KMIP Server Port]
# KMIP_Port is tier-aware
# Do not set the port value to 9443 because this is the port typically used
# to connect to the management console.
KMIP_Port=9001

#[Network Configuration]
# [Protocol]
# The protocol used between the client and the NAE server.
#
# If you are load balancing across multiple NAE servers, the protocol must
# be the same for each server.
# Protocol is tier-aware.  KMIP works only with ssl.
#
# Valid values: tcp, ssl.
# Default: tcp
# Recommended: ssl
#
Protocol=tcp
#Protocol=ssl


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Persistent Connections]
# Enable or disable persistent connections.
#
# If enabled, the client will use a pool of persistent connections to the
# NAE server. If disabled, a new connection will be created and then
# closed for each request.
#
# Valid values: yes, no.
# Default: yes
# Recommended: yes
#
Use_Persistent_Connections=yes


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Pooling]
# The maximum number of connections in the persistent connection pool.
#
# This value is used only when persistent connections are enabled.
# Size_of_Connection_Pool is tier-aware.
#
# Default: 300
#
Size_of_Connection_Pool=300


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Timeout]
# The timeout when connecting to the NAE server.
#
# The timeout is specified in milliseconds. The client will wait for the
# specified number of milliseconds when trying to connect to each NAE
# server.
#
# Setting this value to 0 uses the system connect() timeout.
#
# Caution: Setting this value too low may cause connections to fail when
# the NAE servers and/or network are under load. Do not change it unless
# you really need to.
# Connection_Timeout is tier-aware.
#
# Default: 30000
#
Connection_Timeout=30000

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Read Timeout]
# The timeout when reading from the NAE server.
#
# The timeout can be specified in milliseconds. The client will wait for the
# specified time when trying to read data from the NAE server.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
# Connection_Read_Timeout is tier-aware.
# Default: 30000
#
Connection_Read_Timeout=30000

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Idle Timeout]
# The time a connection is allowed to be idle in the connection pool
# before it gets closed automatically by the client.
#
# The timeout is specified in milliseconds. The client will check how long
# each connection has been idle for. If the time has passed the value
# specified here, the client will close the connection and remove it from
# the connection pool. To be effective, this setting must be less than the
# Connection Timeout setting in the NAE Server Settings section in the
# Management Console of the NAE server.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
# Connection_Idle_Timeout is tier-aware.
#
# Default: 600000
#
Connection_Idle_Timeout=600000


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Retry]
# The amount of time to wait before trying to reconnect to a disabled
# server.
#
# The retry interval is specified in milliseconds. If one of the NAE
# servers in a load balanced configuration is not reachable, the client
# will disable this server, and then wait for the specified number of
# milliseconds before trying to connect to it again.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite retry interval
# (meaning the disabled server will never be brought back into use).
# Connection_Retry_Interval is tier-aware.
#
# Default: 600000
#
Connection_Retry_Interval=600000


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Cluster_Synchronization_Delay]
# The total amount of time to spend trying to make requests on keys
# go to the same device the key create or latest key modify went to.
#
# A device tries to replicate key information to other devices in the
# cluster after it completes a key create or modify request.  Until
# that replication completes, requests on the key need to go to the
# device pushing the replication.
#
# If replication fails, the device waits for 30 seconds, then
# tries again.  If three replications fail, the device stops trying
# to replicate data.
#
# The default is 100 seconds: 3 times 30 seconds plus a few extra
# seconds per try for network latency.  For larger clusters additional
# time may be needed.
# 
# Disable the function: 0 seconds
#
# Default: 100 seconds
#
Cluster_Synchronization_Delay=100

#[Connection Configuration]
# [EdgeSecure Name]
# Name of device or file containing the name of an EdgeSecure device.
#
# The name of an EdgeSecure device is a unique value assigned
# by the administrator to define a single device.
#
# If the name refers to a readable file, then the first line in the file
# defines the name of an EdgeSecure device.  This allows all properties
# files stored on different platforms to be the same and still allow
# each platform to refer to a different EdgeSecure device.
#
# EdgeSecure_Name is tier-aware.
#
# Default: none
#
#EdgeSecure_Name=



#[SSL/TLS Configuration]
# [Cipherspec]
# The SSL/TLS protocol and encryption algorithms to use.

# or AES.
# Cipher_Spec is tier-aware.
#
# Default: HIGH:!ADH:!DH:!DSA:!EXPORT:RSA+RC4:RSA+DES:RSA+AES
#
#Cipher_Spec=HIGH:!ADH:!DH:!DSA:!EXPORT:RSA+RC4:RSA+DES:RSA+AES


#[SSL/TLS Configuration]
# [CA Certificate for Server Authentication]
# The CA certificate that signed the NAE server certificate presented to
# clients to establish SSL connections.
#
# If you are using SSL between the client and server, you must specify a
# path to the CA certificate that signed the NAE server certificate. If
# the client cannot validate the certificate presented by the NAE server,
# the client will not be able to establish an SSL connection with the NAE
# server.
#
# You should provide the path and file name of the CA certificate. The
# path can be absolute or relative to the application. Do not use quotes
# when specifying the path, even if it contains spaces.
# CA_File is tier-aware.
#
# No default.

#[SSL/TLS Configuration]
# [Client Private Key Passphrase]
# The passphrase to unlock the client private key specified in Key_File.
#
# This value is required when client certificate authentication is enabled
# on the NAE server. Since the value is in the clear, this properties file
# must have its permission restricted so that it can be read only by the
# applications that are to have legitimate access to it.
# Passphrase is tier-aware.
#
# No default.
#
Passphrase=
#Passphrase=password

#[Local Encryption Configuration]
# [Passphrase_Encrypted]
# The Passphrase_Encrypted to Enable/Disable the obfuscation of the passphrase for client private key specified in Key_File.
#
# This value is required to Enable/Disable the obfuscation of the passphrase 
# for client private key specified in Key_File
# obfuscated PassPhrase can be generated by using utility "PassPhraseSecure"
# 
# Valid values: yes, no
# Default: no
# Recommended: yes
#
Passphrase_Encrypted=no

#[Local Encryption Configuration]
# [Symmetric Key Caching]
# Enables key caching.
#
# If enabled, the client will be able to use symmetric keys to encrypt
# data locally.  If disabled, only remote encryption will be supported.
# Should only be enabled with Protocol set to ssl.  To allow key caching
# over both unsecured communication(tcp) and ssl connections, set  
# this variable to tcp_ok. To use KMIP for exporting keys use kmip_yes.
#
# Valid values: yes, no, tcp_ok, kmip_yes
# Default: no
# Recommended: no
#
Symmetric_Key_Cache_Enabled=no


#[Local Encryption Configuration]
# [Symmetric Key Cache Expiry]
# Seconds after which a key may be removed from cache.
#
# The expiration interval is specified in seconds. If the time expires
# and the key is referenced, it will be erased from the cache and
# imported from the NAE server.
#
# This value has to be greater than or equal to 0 for key caching to work.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
#
# Default: 43200 (12 hours)
#
Symmetric_Key_Cache_Expiry=43200


# [Persistent Key Caching]
# [Persistent_Cache_Enabled]
# Enables persistent key caching during local encryption.
#
# To persist symmetric keys Symmetric_Key_Cache_Enabled must be set to
# "yes" or "tcp_ok", Persistent_Cache_Enabled must be set to "yes",
# Persistent_Cache_Expiry set to a zero or positive value, and
# Persistent_Cache_Directory set to an existing directory.
# If Symmetric_Key_Cache_Enabled or Public_Key_Cache_Enabled is set
# to "no", all Persistent_Cache_* properties will be ignored.
#
# Valid values: yes, no
# Default: no
# Recommended: no
#
Persistent_Cache_Enabled=no

# [Persistent Key Caching]
# [Persistent Cache Directory]
# The location of the directory which will contain the persistent key caches.
#
# Provide just the path to a directory where the provider will create the
# persistent cache file.  The value can be absolute or relative to the
# application.  Do not use quotes when specifying the path, even if it contains spaces.
# On Windows platforms, the value must not equal just a backslash (\) or end
# with a backslash if not a root directory (e.g., C:\ is okay, however C:\TEMP\
# is not).
#
# default: none 
#
Persistent_Cache_Directory=

# [Persistent Key Caching]
# [Persistent Key Cache Expiry Keys]
# Seconds after which a key may be removed from cache.

#[Logging Configuration]
# [Log Level]
# The level of logging that will be performed by the client.
#
# The log level determines how verbose your client logs are. You can
# disable logging by selecting NONE; however, it is recommended that you
# set the log level to MEDIUM. A log level of HIGH can create a very large
# log file. Set the log level to HIGH to troubleshoot configuration
# problems.
